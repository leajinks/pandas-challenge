Module 4 Pandas Weekly Challenge Report

In this assignment, school data for a particular city is compared to students' performances in reading and math in order to identify any trends between school characteristics and student grades. 

One of the most apparent conclusions to draw from this data is that school type is a strong predictor of student performance. Students in district schools score consistently worse in reading and math than their counterparts in charter schools, regardless of their grade level. One might draw the conclusion that perhaps district schools aren't funded as well as charter schools, however, the opposite is true - more money is spent per student per year in district schools. In the data provided, the budget per student is not broken down by areas of spending, so it may be that while district schools spend more per student, they are not spending as much per student for reading and math as charter schools. Further analysis into specific budget areas may yield more insight into this matter.

An additional factor that may hint at factors affecting student performance is school size. While small (<1000 students) and medium (1000-2000 students) sized schools had similar overall average grade performances, large schools (2000-5000 students) performed significantly lower. Since District schools all have over 2000 students, this may shed more light on student performance than per student budget. The data sets lack information on the quantity of faculty and staff available to support students, but it may be worth comparing numbers of these personnel to quantity of students to determine what affect students per teacher has on grade performance.

In conclusion, this data likely doesn't provide clear direction for future budgeting needs. Further investigation into per-student budgets and staffing should be considered prior to confirming future budget allocations.
